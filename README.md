# MIT-DONT-BOTHER-ME
I just want to write some code. Don't bother me, and take the software as you want.
## Feature
MIT-DNBM is the best choice for a modder who publishes open-sourced mods in [Minecraft CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/).
It can protect him(her) from a lot of useless ruquests for reposting mods to another website.
