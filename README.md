# MIT-DO-NOT-BOTHER-ME(MIT-DNBM)

I just want to write some code. Don't bother me, and take the software as you want.

## Feature

MIT-DNBM is the best choice for a modder who publishes open-sourced mods in [Minecraft CurseForge](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/). It can protect him(her) from a lot of useless requests for reposting mods to another website.
